# Hellfire Design Inspiration

A collection of websites that inspire the visual direction for WouldYouPay/Hellfire.

## Strategic Direction

**Primary Focus:** Main wouldyoupay.io homepage — the platform itself

**Target Audience:** Builders (AI-accelerated and traditional) who want to validate ideas before building

**The Platform Vision:** WouldYouPay.io is a community platform where any builder can test an idea by creating a landing page and gauging real interest. The platform itself is the business.

**Design Direction:**
- Modern technical appeal that resonates with builders
- Pixelated/retro styles — signals hacker/builder culture
- Strong colour choices and overall aesthetic
- Distinctive, not generic SaaS
- Feels "made by builders, for builders"
