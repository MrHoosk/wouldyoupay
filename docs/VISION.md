# WouldYouPay.io — Product Vision

> **Validate before you build.**

## The Problem

Builders — especially those accelerated by AI — can now ship ideas faster than ever. But speed creates a new problem: building things nobody wants.

The traditional approach:
1. Have an idea
2. Spend weeks/months building
3. Launch and hope
4. Discover nobody cares
5. Repeat

**80% of startups fail because they build something nobody wants.** The solution isn't to build faster — it's to validate faster.

## The Solution

**WouldYouPay.io** is a platform where builders test ideas before writing a single line of code.

### How It Works

1. **Register your idea** — Describe what you want to build
2. **Get a landing page** — Instantly generate a "Would You Pay?" page
3. **Share and measure** — Real people signal real interest
4. **Decide with data** — Build what people actually want

### The Core Question

Every landing page asks one simple question:

> "Would you pay for this?"

Not "would you use this" (everyone says yes to free).  
Not "do you like this idea" (opinions are cheap).  
**Would you pay?** — the only question that matters.

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Builders accelerated by AI
- Solo developers shipping with Cursor, Claude, GPT
- Indie hackers and micro-SaaS founders
- Technical founders validating B2B ideas

**Secondary:** Traditional builders
- Early-stage startup founders
- Product managers testing new features
- Agencies validating client ideas

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Focus | Our Differentiation |
|------------|-------|---------------------|
| Product Hunt | Launch announcement | We're pre-launch validation |
| Launchrock | Email collection | We measure purchase intent |
| Gumroad | Selling products | We validate before you build |
| Typeform | Surveys | We're purpose-built for idea validation |

**Our position:** The first step in every builder's journey — before code, before launch, before investment.

## Design Principles

1. **Builder-first aesthetic** — Technical, distinctive, not corporate SaaS
2. **Speed obsessed** — Idea to landing page in under 60 seconds
3. **Data-driven decisions** — Clear metrics, not vanity numbers
4. **Community powered** — Builders helping builders

## Success Metrics

- **North Star:** Ideas validated per month
- **Activation:** Time from signup to first landing page live
- **Engagement:** Return visits to check analytics
- **Conversion:** Free → Pro upgrades
- **Virality:** Ideas shared / landing pages created

## Dogfooding

We use WouldYouPay.io to test our own ideas. Current test pages:

- Compliance tools (landlord, mtdbridge, carehome, ir35, gdpr, etc.)
- AI tools (aiagent, aimeetings, aisupport, etc.)
- SME tools (invoicechaser, expenses, stockmanager, etc.)
- Services (websiteweek, seoaudit, quotecraft)

**Total ideas in testing:** 31

If an idea gets traction, we build it. If it doesn't, we move on. This is the product working as intended.

## Taglines (Testing)

- "Validate before you build"
- "Would they pay? Find out first."
- "The first step for every builder"
- "Stop building things nobody wants"
- "Test ideas, not patience"
