# WouldYouPay.io — Competitor Analysis

**Date:** 2026-01-30  
**Purpose:** Understand competitive landscape and validate pricing strategy

---

## Executive Summary

WouldYouPay.io enters a market with **two distinct competitor types**:

1. **Direct competitors** — Idea validation platforms (landing page + signup capture + analytics)
2. **Indirect competitors** — Generic landing page builders (more features, higher price, different positioning)

**Key Finding:** The "idea validation" niche is **underserved**. Most tools are either:
- Too expensive (enterprise landing page builders at £30-100+/mo)
- Too generic (don't position around validation)
- One-time payment (limits recurring revenue)

**Opportunity:** WouldYouPay.io can own the "validate before you build" positioning with **builder-focused branding** and **accessible subscription pricing**.

## Pricing Recommendation

### Current Proposed Pricing (from VISION.md)

| Tier | Price |
|------|-------|
| Free | £0 (2 ideas) |
| Pro | £9/mo or £90/year |

### Analysis

**£9/mo is well-positioned:**

✅ **Below Leadpages** (£25/mo) — accessible to indie hackers  
✅ **Above Carrd** (£4/mo) — room for more features  
✅ **Recurring vs ValidateIdea.io** — sustainable revenue model  
✅ **Builder-friendly** — matches target audience's budget

### Recommended Pricing Adjustments

Consider **tiered pricing** to capture more value:

| Tier | Price | Ideas | Features |
|------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | £0 | 2 | Basic analytics, WYP branding |
| **Builder** | £9/mo | 10 | Full analytics, no branding, export |
| **Studio** | £19/mo | Unlimited | Custom domains, A/B testing, API |
| **Annual** | 2 months free | — | £90 Builder / £190 Studio |

**Rationale:**
- **£9/mo Builder** — Captures indie hackers, competitive with ValidateIdea.io over time
- **£19/mo Studio** — Captures power users and agencies, still below Leadpages
- **Annual discount** — Improves cash flow, reduces churn
